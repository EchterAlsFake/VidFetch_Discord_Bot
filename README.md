## Common Bugs and Errors

You will probably sometimes face an error. This is normal and I am always trying to fix it as fast as I can.

All errors are logged in a file. I will have a look at this file from time to time and try to fix the stuff.

But you can do some things too:


- Make sure the video is not blocked in Germany
- Make sure the video has no age restriction
- Make sure the video doesn't exceed 8MB filesize  (Because of Discord Limits...)
- Make sure the video is a public video which can be accessed by everyone


#### Downloads can take some time  ~ 2-3 minutes.  This is normal!
