# Description

Vid Fetch Discord Bot is a discord bot made for

<br> from YouTube and sending them back to the user. The Bot can download
<br> a single video or a whole YouTube playlist with integrated threading support.

# Features:

- m4a codec support
- Download a whole playlist
- Get a direct download link for videos
- Integrated threading for faster download
- Intuitive application commands

# Requirements

- The downloaded music video MUST NOT exceed 8MB size
- The video MUST NOT be blocked in Germany
- You need to have private DMs from server members enabled in your DC

# Open Source information

The code here is exactly the same, which is running in the background,
<br>when you use it. 
I need to keep the background running application closed,
<br>to prevent leaking the API key.
If you don't trust me, you can easily
<br> all my code, create your own bot on discord developer portal and use your
<br>own API key :)
