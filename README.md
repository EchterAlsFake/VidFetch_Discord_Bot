# What is it? 

Vid Fetch Bot is a Discord Bot, which downloads YouTube Videos and sends them back to the
user as .m4a file. It can download all kind of music videos in average of 30 seconds. It has an easy application command interface.

The Bot was created on 6th April in 2023 by EchterAlsFake

# Availability

I have no money for servers. I am currently hosting this Bot on my old Laptop with my own Network. My Internet speed is 12.5 Megabytes per second (100000). It should be no problem to down and upload all videos.
My Laptop is ancient. You can expect, that it maybe crashes or sometimes anything gets stuck. In this case, Just come back and try again later ;)

## Common Bugs and Errors

You will probably sometimes face an error. This is normal and I am always trying to fix it as fast as I can.

But you can do some things too:


- Make sure the video is not blocked in Germany
- Make sure the video has no age restriction
- Make sure the video doesn't exceed 8MB filesize  (Because of Discord Limits...)
- Make sure the video is a public video which can be accessed by everyone


#### Downloads can take some time  ~ 1-3 minutes.  This is normal!
