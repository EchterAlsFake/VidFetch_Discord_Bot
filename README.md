# Requirements

- The downloaded music video MUST NOT exceed 8MB size
- The video MUST NOT be blocked in Germany
- You need to have private DMs from server members enabled in your DC

# Open Source information

The code here is exactly the same, which is running in the background,
<br>when you use it. 
I need to keep the background running application closed,
<br>to prevent leaking the API key.
If you don't trust me, you can easily copy
<br> all of my code, create your own bot on the discord developer portal and use your
<br>own API key :) 
# Hosting

I have no resources to buy a hosting server for the bot.
<br>In the past I had my old laptop for hosting, but it died
<br> sometimes I can host the bot from my main PC or my phone but
<br>that are unstable methods.

# BUT 

You can host it by yourself with one click!
<br>Go [here](https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/VidFetch_Discord_Bot/releases)
<br>Select the version for either Linux or Windows
<br>Run it :)
